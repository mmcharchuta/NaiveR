# NaiveR

NaiveR is an R package for classifying DNA sequences into taxonomic groupings using a Na√Øve Bayesian Classifier, inspired by the Ribosomal Database Project. It is designed for 16S rRNA gene sequences but can be used for any gene sequence classification.

## Features
- Read and write FASTA files
- Build k-mer databases
- Classify unknown DNA sequences
- Taxonomy filtering and printing utilities
- Fast computation using Rcpp and Rfast

## Installation

Install dependencies in R:
```r
install.packages(c("devtools", "Rcpp", "readr", "Rfast", "stringi", "dplyr", "purrr", "testthat", "knitr", "rmarkdown"))
```

Clone this repository and install the package:
```r
devtools::load_all(".", recompile = TRUE)
# or
# devtools::install()
```

## Usage Example
```r
library(NaiveR)
# Read a FASTA file
fasta <- read_fasta("path/to/your.fasta")
# Build a k-mer database
kdb <- build_kmer_database(fasta)
# Classify a new sequence
result <- classify_sequence(unknown_seq = "ACGTACGT...", db = kdb)
print(result)
```
